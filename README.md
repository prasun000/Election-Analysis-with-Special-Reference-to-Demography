# Election-Analysis-with-Special-Reference-to-Demography
Analysis the previous three West Bengal Legislative Assembly elections

We analyze the previous three West Bengal Legislative Assembly elections. We start with trend analysis for each constituency and district. Next, we check if there is ‘Demographic Divide’ among the various demographic groups based on the three WBLA Elections. In Statistical terms, Say C is a class of voters in which the voters are assumed to be iid (henceforth referred to as blocks) and A is a political party/alliance. We wish to find if there is any significant relation between C and votes to party A. We also find if there are any districts which behave abnormally as compared to the state via Mahalanobis distance.
